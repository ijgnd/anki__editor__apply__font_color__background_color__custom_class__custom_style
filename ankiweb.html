This add-on offers more styling options for the Anki editor: You can quickly set different font colors, background colors, font sizes or apply custom classes or styles. You can use shortcuts, buttons from the top of the editor or the context menu. 

If you want to use a custom style but don't know css there are online sites that make creating styles easier. A google search lead to sites like <a href="https://html-css-js.com/css/generator/font/" rel="nofollow">this one</a> or <a href="https://webdesign-assistant.com/font-editor/css-font-generator.php" rel="nofollow">this one</a>.

<b># Functions</b>
This add-on offers the following options:
1. directly changing the <b>font color by changing the html color attribute</b>. This is also built into Anki but switching between different colors is time consuming. You can set different font colors with the "Quick Colour Changing" add-on. This add-on additionally gives you the option to have multiple dedicated buttons or menu entries for font colors you often use. But my add-on  might be easier to use.
2. you can set the <b>background color directly using the html background-color attribute</b>. The option to change the background color is also available in the add-on "Mini Format Pack". But switching between different colors is time consuming.
3. you can <b>style text with the html style attribute</b>.
4. you can set <b>css</b> for custom <b>classes</b> and apply these classes to the text selected using the inline "<b>span</b>" tag or using the "<b>div</b>" tag which is a block element which means you'll have a line-break before and after it. Some styling only makes sense when it's applied to a div.
5. There's are easy to use dialogs/options to change the font color, the background color, and the font size by using css and html classes. This has some advantages and some drawabacks: html classes are roughly similar to "styles" that you can apply in Word or LibreOffice. When you use html classes you can later change the color for all the fonts you've highlighted at the same time and you can also set different colors for night mode.
6. You can wrap the text selected with custom text snippets, see below.

<b># Text Wrapping</b>
You can wrap selected text with fixed text snippets, e.g. you can set up a shortcut with "before" set to "Art ", and "after" set to " TFEU".
This lets you wrap, e.g., "2" in the Editor, and it will become "Art 2 TFEU" (which is Article 2 of the Treaty on the 
Functioning of the European Union). This is useful for any kind of repetitive typing.

the text wrapping function is useful for <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/272311064" rel="nofollow">hgiesel's Closet For Anki</a>. Text Wrapping also supports counters that take the current field into account. The best way to show this is with an example:
- Having "before" set to "{{c<i>%i</i>::", and "after" to "}}", makes a text wrapper that mimics the built-in Ctrl-Shift-C cloze shortcut (think of <i>%i</i> as increment).
- Having "before" set to "{{c<i>%t</i>::", and "after" to "}}", makes a text wrapper that mimics the  built-in Ctrl-Alt-Shift-C cloze shortcut (think of <i>%t</i> as top).
This is useful if you want to set the cloze shortcut to a custom key, or any add-on that mimics the built-in clozes in some way, see e.g. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/72bov4/what_are_my_options_to_work_around_the_cloze_card/" rel="nofollow">here</a>. If you want a naked percentage sign, use  "%%". 

<b># Setup</b>
Each note type <i>MUST</i> have the string <code>@import url("_editor_button_styles.css");</code> at the top(!) of the "Styling" section in the "Card Types for ..." window. I've had many "bug" reports where people didn't do this so this add-on offers to automatically adjust all notes types.

<b># updating the styling on AnkiMobile</b>
(In 2021) changes to your config are only applied in AnkiMobile on my iphone after I force close and reopen Ankimobile. With "force close" I mean: double click the home button, then swipe up on the app's preview.

<b># bugs, errors, feedback</b>
Please do not use reviews for bug reports or support requests. I don't get notified of your reviews, and properly troubleshooting an issue through them is nearly impossible (formatting is limited and I can't reply multiple times). If you find a bug let me know <a href="https://forums.ankiweb.net/t/editor-apply-font-color-background-color-custom-class-custom-style-official-thread/550" rel="nofollow">in the official anki support forum</a>.

<b># Alternatives</b>
If you just want to sometimes change the text color or background color this add-on might be overkill. Or maybe you find the config too complicated. Or maybe you run into an error with this add-on. Then you could have a look at these options:
- The option to change the background color is available in the <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/295889520" rel="nofollow">Mini Format Pack</a>. But switching between different colors is time consuming.
- Anki has a function to change the font color. But switching between different colors is time consuming.
- There's the add-on <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2491935955" rel="nofollow">Quick Colour Changing</a> that allows to set shortcuts for different font colors.
- the <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/805891399" rel="nofollow">extended editor for field</a> allows to edit <i>one</i> field in a powerful WYYIWYG editor (TinyMCE)
